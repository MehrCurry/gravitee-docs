== Overview

This page explains how to configure API definitions with Design Studio.

You can use Design Studio to create new API flows for your plans and define policies for each flow.
Creating different flows for a plan allows you to apply different policies by path and/or HTTP method.

NOTE: Don't forget to click the *deploy your API* link when making changes to your API!

== Get started with Design Studio

. link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html[Log in to APIM Console^].
. Click *APIs* and select your API in the list.
. Click *Design*.
. If your API was created in an earlier version of APIM, migrate it to Design Studio as described in link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_migrate.html[Migrate to Design Studio^].

== Create and configure an API flow

You can create flows at API level or at plan level.

. In the *DESIGN* tab, click the *API* tab to design a new API level flow or *PLANS* to create a new plan level flow.

. Double-click the flow to configure its details.
+

+
Configure the following:

* Name
* Path details to filter on: the path syntax for the flow in link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_overview.html#ant-notation[Ant format^] and whether the path starts with or equals the value entered in *Path*.
* One or methods to filter on (specify all which apply)
* One or more conditions to filter on, in link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_expression_language.html[Expression Language format^] -- for example, a condition to filter on query parameters called `X-debug` would be written like this: `#request.params['X-debug'] != null`

. Click *SAVE*.

TIP: You can update a flow by clicking it and changing any required values, then clicking the tick icon image:icons/tick-icon.png[role="icon"] to update the values.

== Additional flow properties

Once you have created your basic flow definition, you can specify additional properties as described below.

=== Specify Best match for your flow path

In the *CONFIGURATION* tab, select *Best match* if you want APIM to match this flow from the path that is closest to that defined in the flow definition.

=== Add global properties to your flow

In the *PROPERTIES* tab, specify global properties as property key-value pairs. Click *CONFIGURE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES* to configure properties fetched with a URL and subsequently updated according to the details you specify.

[[create-resources]]
=== Create resources to use in your flows

In the *RESOURCES* tab, create new resources to use in your flows. You can add resources to a policy when configuring it for a flow.

image:apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/design-studio/resources-tab.png[]

* `Cache` resources can be added to a `Cache` policy
* `Generic OAuth2 Authorization Server` resources can be added to an `OAuth2` policy
* `Gravitee.io AM Authorization Server` resources can be added to an `OAuth2` policy

For example, specify a cache resource as follows:

. Click *CACHE*.
+

. Enter the cache name.
. Specify the cache properties: time to idle, time to live and max entries on heap.
. Click the tick icon image:icons/tick-icon.png[role="icon"].
. Click *SAVE*.

[[flow-policies]]
== Add policies to a flow

You can add as many policies as you want to a flow.

TIP: You can find out more about a specific policy by selecting it to view the in-product reference documentation, or you can view the online Policy Reference link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_overview.html[here^].

. Click the *DESIGN* tab.
. Click on a plan to expand it.
+
image:apim\3.x\api-publisher-guide\design-studio\add-policies-expand-plan.png[]
. From the list on the right, drag the policy to the required phase of the flow.
+
image:apim\3.x\api-publisher-guide\design-studio\add-policies-new-policy.png[]
. Specify the details of the policy configuration. If this is a `Cache` or `OAuth2` type policy, you can add the corresponding resources created in <<Create resources to use in your flows>>.
. Click *SAVE*.

TIP: If you hover over a policy in a flow you can perform various operations on it: drag the policy to another phase of the flow, disable, delete or duplicate the policy.
